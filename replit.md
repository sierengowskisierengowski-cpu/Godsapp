# GodsApp

Native GTK4 + libadwaita desktop application providing a unified interface for security auditing & research (recon, web app testing, network analysis, password auditing, exploitation, OSINT, forensics, malware analysis, crypto, mobile, cloud, wireless). Built by Joseph Sierengowski. This Replit workspace is the source-of-truth repository — the app itself is installed and run on a Linux desktop (COSMIC, GNOME, KDE — anything with GTK4 + libadwaita).

## Source of truth

All app code lives at `./godsapp/`:

```
godsapp/
    pyproject.toml          # setuptools.build_meta backend
    install.sh              # installs into /opt/godsapp/{venv,app}
    uninstall.sh
    godsapp/                # the actual Python package
        app/                # GTK Adw.Application bootstrap
        ui/                 # GTK4 + libadwaita views
        core/               # workspaces, evidence, scans, health, audit, settings, paths
        db/                 # SQLAlchemy 2.x models + engine + migrations
        api/                # FastAPI REST server (off by default, 127.0.0.1)
        cli/                # Click CLI
        tools/              # built-in tools (recon/nmap, recon/subdomain-brute)
        plugins/            # plugin authoring contract
        resources/css/      # Adwaita CSS overrides (cream/ivory on dark)
    packaging/              # PKGBUILD, debian/, appimage/, flatpak/
    tests/                  # pytest smoke tests
```

## Run & operate (on the user's Linux box)

- Install:        `sudo ./install.sh` (or `./install.sh --user`)
- Launch GUI:     `godsapp`
- CLI:            `godsapp-cli --help`
- Health probe:   `godsapp-cli health`
- Enable API:     `systemctl --user enable --now godsapp-api`
- Uninstall:      `sudo ./uninstall.sh` (add `--purge` to wipe user data)

System prereqs (one-time): `python3 (>=3.12) python-gobject gtk4 libadwaita`.

## Storage

- Config:  `~/.config/godsapp/` (settings.toml, api.token)
- Data:    `~/.local/share/godsapp/` (godsapp.db, logs/, evidence/, workspaces/, plugins/, cache/)
- DB:      SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL via `GODSAPP_DATABASE_URL`

## Architecture decisions

- **`setuptools.build_meta` backend** in pyproject (Meli lesson: `flit_core` blows up on packages with native deps in transitive trees).
- **install.sh runs `pip install .`** into the venv. Never relies on `PYTHONPATH` for the app code — only for systemd units. (Meli lesson.)
- **`json.dumps(..., default=str)` centralised in `core/jsonx.py`** — every datetime, Path, UUID renders safely. (Meli lesson.)
- **install.sh creates every data directory upfront** so first launch never hits a missing-dir error. (Meli lesson.)
- **Backend health is surfaced in the header bar and dashboard** so the user can see DB/API/tool availability instead of buttons silently doing nothing. (Meli lesson.)
- **Evidence locker is content-addressed (`sha256[:2]/sha256.<ext>`)** so duplicate ingests collapse and integrity is verifiable; every action lands in a chain-of-custody row.
- **Generic `ScanView` auto-renders forms from `tool.options`** — adding a new tool means subclassing `Tool` and registering; UI/CLI/API pick it up automatically.
- **`ScanRunner.run()` returns a `CompletedScan` dataclass (not the ORM row)** with findings eagerly snapshotted to `FindingDTO`s inside the session. Returning the live `Scan` row after the session closed caused `DetachedInstanceError` whenever the UI/CLI/API touched `.findings`.
- **All `audit()` calls happen AFTER the originating `with get_session():` block closes.** SQLite is single-writer; nesting `audit()` (which opens its own session) inside an open transaction reliably deadlocks under WAL.
- **install.sh resolves the *invoking* user via `SUDO_USER` upfront** and writes data dirs + the systemd user unit directly into that user's `~/.config/systemd/user/`. Writing to `/etc/skel` only seeds *future* users; existing users would never find the unit.
- **Baseline is libadwaita 1.4+ / GTK 4.10+** (Arch, Fedora 39+, Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 13). The UI uses `Adw.NavigationSplitView`, `Adw.NavigationPage`, `Adw.ToolbarView`, and `Gtk.FileDialog` — all introduced in that range. install.sh probes for those symbols and bails with an actionable error on older stacks (Debian 12 → use the Flatpak or AppImage).

## Replit workspace notes

The only other thing in the workspace is `artifacts/mockup-sandbox/` — Replit canvas infrastructure, untouched. The Python app cannot render in Replit's preview pane (GTK4 needs an X/Wayland display); development feedback loop is: the user installs locally on their COSMIC machine and reports bugs.

## User preferences

- Author: Joseph Sierengowski
- App ID: `com.sierengowski.GodsApp`
- License: GPL-3.0-or-later
- Aesthetic: warm cream/ivory on a deep dark base; bolt-glyph branding
- Quality bar: real implementations only — no placeholders, no "coming soon"
- Distribution: install.sh + PKGBUILD + .deb + AppImage + Flatpak (all paths supported)

## Gotchas

- Venv MUST be created with `--system-site-packages` so PyGObject can see the distro's GTK4 typelibs. The installer does this automatically.
- The systemd user unit needs `Environment=PYTHONPATH=/opt/godsapp/app` if the launcher is bypassed; the bundled launcher (`/usr/local/bin/godsapp`) calls the venv binary directly, so PYTHONPATH is only used as a belt-and-suspenders.
- On Debian/Ubuntu, `gir1.2-adw-1` is sometimes named `gir1.2-libadwaita-1` on older releases; the installer surfaces a clear error if it can't import `Adw`.

## Status — v0.1.0

Foundation complete:
- Wipe of legacy Node/web GodsApp ✓
- Python project skeleton + pyproject ✓
- SQLAlchemy DB layer ✓
- Core services (workspaces, evidence, scans, health, audit, registry) ✓
- GTK4 + Adwaita shell (header, sidebar, 12 category sections, dashboard, workspaces, evidence, settings) ✓
- Recon category fully wired (nmap + subdomain-brute) ✓
- FastAPI REST server (off by default, token auth) ✓
- Click CLI (workspace, tool, scan, evidence, api, health) ✓
- install.sh + uninstall.sh + .desktop + launcher + systemd user unit ✓
- PKGBUILD, debian/, AppImage recipe, Flatpak manifest ✓
- README + CONTRIBUTING ✓
- Smoke tests ✓

Follow-ups (planned after install verification on COSMIC):
- Remaining 11 tool categories (web, network, password, exploit, wireless, forensics, malware, osint, crypto, mobile, cloud) — each follows the proven pattern (`Tool` subclass → register → auto-rendered in UI/CLI/API).
- Report generator (HTML/PDF/markdown export aggregating scans + findings + evidence per workspace).
- Scheduler executing the `schedules` table on a cron-like timer.
- Plugin marketplace UI (install/uninstall plugins from a curated index).
